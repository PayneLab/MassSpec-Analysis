# MassSpec-Analysis

Mass Spectrometers produce .raw files. These can be read by a small handful of programs, such as Thermo's software that runs the mass spec. One commonly used program is MaxQuant. It takes the .raw and a fasta file, then analyses the data. It then returns a folder that contains information in several file types, including .txt.
